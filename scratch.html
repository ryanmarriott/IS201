    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Sports - My entire life has beem centered around sports in some sort of way. As I've grown older, I have gained a greater love for them and still find myself involved in them in any way I can.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Football: I have always enjoyed playing football my entire life. I played flag football when I was in elementary school, and then picked football back up in high school. I was also lucky enough to continue playing at the JUCO level at a new post high school prep program down in St. George, called the St. George Eagles.</li>

                <li>Basketball: The first sport I really loved to play, I was a super tall kid so I have tons of memories of being able to score super easily. However, I did join a club team where the coach turned on the team and that killed my love to play organized team basketball. I still love basketball and it is probably my favorite sport to watch.</li><br>
                <li>Soccer and Baseball: Both fun sports to play; however, multiple hour long games and practices every week in the Arizona summer really is not that fun, as one can imagine. Even though I was pretty good, I quit both sports because I didn't like the heat that much.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Video Games - My favorite way to be able to virtually hang out with friends or be able to do something in my downtime. I enjoy being able to physically control something on the screen versus sitting back watching TV or a movie.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sports Video Games: One of the ways I still connect myself to sports. I enjoy being able to put myself in the shoes of professional athletes or coaches and see how great I can become. I also enjoy being able to challenge my friends to games using our favorite teams to simulate what team is better.</li><br>
                <li>Battle Royales/FPS Games: I enjoy these games because I love the constant action and the excitement that comes with winning. My biggest downside to them is they are not as fun to play by yourself so I usually have to beg a friend to get on to play with.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Computers - one of my biggest interests and something I have always enjoyed learning about.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parts and Components: I have always loved learning about how the different parts and compenents of computers work, how they provide information to other systems in the computer, and how they are effected by user input. I enjoyed in the beggining of the IS 201 class learning about some of the computer parts.</li><br>
                <li>Building a Computer: I have constantly wanted to buy all the parts and build a computer for myself, just never had the money to do so. I enjoy being able to build stuff for myself (Ikea furniture is the best) and see the finsihed project. I used to go onto different websites and virtually build a pc for myself in hopes I could physically do it one day. </li><br>
                <li>Fascination: One of the reasons I enjoy computers is the endless oportunities you have with them. Since I enjoy playing video games, I find it super cool that you can update a certain part once it goes bad, instead of needing to buy a whole new gaming system. I also enjoy all the variability and customization that you get instead of having the same exact Xbox as everyone else does.</li><br>
                <li>Continuation of Interest in Computers: My love for computers has expanded into wanting to learn into different fields of computer customization, such as coding or website building, which I am doing now. It has been a surreal experience finally being able to understand a lot more of what my computer can do and the power that it truly has.</li><br>
            </ul>
         </li>
